This project reads ATom data and interpolates linearly ECHAM-HAM model grid to the location and height of ATom
aircraft.

--Run ATom_ECHAM_compare.py to execute all

--global_vars.py contains all global variables
- Directories to ATom and pressure levels ECHAM data
- height_criteria as the top level to select the data. Near the surface marine aerosols have a greater influence
- name of model variable to compare to ATom
- ATom variable to compare

-- region_cond.py contains the definition of the ocean regions used in the comparison
