This project reads ATom data and interpolates linearly ECHAM-HAM model grid to the location and height of ATom
aircraft.

--Run ATom_ECHAM_compare.py (or sbatch run_python_main.sh in levante) to perform the interpolation. This will generate
a pickle file (stat_exp_regions.pkl) which contains the observation and model interpolated data in addition to the
statistical indices for predefined oceanic regions (region_cond.py) and can later be used for the plots

--global_vars.py contains all global variables
- Directories to ATom and pressure levels ECHAM data
- height_criteria as the top level to select the data. Near the surface marine aerosols have a greater influence
- name of model variable to compare to ATom
- ATom variable to compare

-- plot_bar_stat. py create figures of the comparison of model and measurements color coded for the predefined
oceanic regions for each model experiment (a scatter plot with the data, plus a bar plot with relevant statistics).

-- region_cond.py contains the definition of the ocean regions used in the comparison
